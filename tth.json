    "Gift.Hate.Gray": "เป็นบ้าอะไรของคุณเนี่ย!? อย่าเอาของแบบนั้นมาให้ฉันนะ!",
    "Gift.Hate.Harris": "ผมยอมรับว่ารู้สึกผิดหวัง — ไม่ใช่เพราะความโลภ แต่เพราะผมไม่คิดว่าคุณจะใจร้ายได้ขนาดนี้",
    "Gift.Hate.HarvestGoddess": "อ่า ฉันยกโทษให้ เธอคงไม่รู้จริงๆ ว่าสิ่งนี้มันน่ารังเกียจสำหรับฉันแค่ไหน",
    "Gift.Hate.Jeff": "เฮอะ... เข้าใจแล้วล่ะ ผมว่าผมพอจะเห็นแล้วว่าคุณพยายามจะสื่ออะไร... ผมคงจะทิ้งความประทับใจแย่ๆ ไว้ให้คุณสินะ",

    "Gift.Hate.Manna": "โอ้ ที่รัก...คุณไม่ควรจะเอาของพวกนี้ไปให้คนอื่นนะ มันอาจจะดูหยาบคายได้...ฉันแค่เป็นห่วงคุณเท่านั้นแหละ อย่าทำแบบนี้อีกนะ",
    "Gift.Hate.Marie": "เอ่อ นี่มันอะไรกันเนี่ย?",
    "Gift.Hate.Mei": "นี่หนูต้องรับอันนี้จริงๆ เหรอ?",

There appear to be no particular rules, but the \"thrash\" seems to be the most popular swim style.^^Swimming in the ocean is hard work, so the men are all very serious. This ocean race is quite difficult, and you must take many small breaths or you will tire and have difficulty reaching the finishing line.^^My friend the swimmer says: \"It is better to take short small breaths when long-distance swimming.\" But for us amateurs, it is hard to keep pace even over short distances.^^It is better not to wait until you can't hold your breath any longer.

Some don't even need any urging.\"^^\"But if the owner is not paying enough attention, their chicken might flee out of the ring at the first fright.\" \"...I guess it all comes down to the relationship between man and hen (laugh)\"^^This is what the referee said. The thing that motivates the chicken most is probably the \"Love\" it has received from its owner.^^^\"Village Festivals - 4 - The Tomato Festival\"^^This village holds a Tomato Festival on the 12th day of Summer to celebrate the tomato harvest.^^What the villagers do is have a big food fight with the tomatoes. Most of the villagers participate in this festival, forming teams of 3 people each. It is a festival enjoyed by people of all ages.^^The men can throw faster than the women and children, but in the end it all comes down to how well you can dodge the tomatoes.^^^^\"Village Festivals - 5 - The Dog Race\"^^This village holds a Dog Race on the 10th day of Winter.^^In this race, the owners run as fast as they can and try to get their dogs to follow them to reach the goal first.^^The sight of the dog owners trying so hard to get their dogs to follow them sparks much laughter from the crowd. The interesting part of this race is that it clearly reveals the relationship between dog and owner.^^Dogs that are trained try very hard to keep up with their owners so they can stay close. If a dog has not been trained properly, when it tires and can't keep up it will wander away and forget about the race.^^I asked the host of the dog race whether he had any hints for winning...^\"It's simple. The owner just has to run at the pace of the dog.\"^^That was his answer. I guess that's all there is to it.^^^^Written by^Basil",
    "MapString.MT.Library.6": "\"Flowers - 1 - Mountain Flowers\"^^The mountain I always hike has many different kinds of flowers blooming, depending on the season.^^The most common flower in this village is the Moon Drop. In the spring, some places are completely covered in these yellow flowers.^^In the fall, a flower called the Magic Red blooms. The flowers are normally blue, but sometimes the blossoms are red. The villagers here use the flower for medicine.^^Why these plants sometimes bloom red flowers is a mystery.^^^\"Flowers - 2 - The Flower of Happiness\"^^In the winter, when the mountain is covered in snow, some people claim to have seen a white flower blooming. The villagers call this the \"Flower of Happiness\", saying those who view it are blessed with happiness.^^Other countries have similar stories, and because they are all snowy countries, it is thought to be the same flower.^^^Written by^Basil",

    "MapString.MT.Library.8": "\"Hiking the Mountain - 1\"^^I go mountain hiking once a week with my family to look for plants. There is a hot spring in the mountain that the villagers are free to use.^Last time I went there I was surprised to find eggs in the hot spring, but a farmer and a little girl told me this was a good way to boil eggs.^^Written by^Basil",
    "MapString.MT.Library.9": "\"The Mine Only Accessible In Winter - 1\"^^In the village where I live there are two mines. One is the mine near the hot spring that I wrote about in another book.^^The other is a mine you can only get to in the winter.^^I only know what I heard from the blacksmith, but it seems you can find metal ores in this mine too, so I assume it is somewhere in the mountains of the village.^(Update: The mine was completely destroyed during the \"Large Earthquake\". By the time I got there it was gone. A big crack in the lake is where that mine rest.)^^^^Written by^Basil",
    "MapString.MT.Library.10": "\"The Mine Near The Spring -1\"^^There is a mine in the village where I live, near the hot spring. It is said that you can find metal ores there to make tools with.^^Alexandrite stone is the hardest to find. You need to dig deeper.^^Written by^Basil",
